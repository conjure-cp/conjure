## Repository

Conjure's source code, issue tracker and releases are hosted on the [conjure-cp/conjure](http://www.github.com/conjure-cp/conjure) Github repository.

You are very welcome to submit issues and pull requests!

### A note about imported issues

The [conjure-cp/conjure](http://www.github.com/conjure-cp/conjure) repository is the 3rd home of Conjure's development repository.
Feel free to ignore this section if you don't care about it.

We used to use mercurial hosted on BitBucket in the past: and two separate repositories over time!
We have imported the issues from the BitBucket repositories in order not to lose them into the [conjure-cp/conjure](http://www.github.com/conjure-cp/conjure) repository.

For reference, the imported issues on the [conjure-cp/conjure](http://www.github.com/conjure-cp/conjure) repository are the following:

- issues 2-271 correspond to issues 1-270 from bitbucket/conjure-old
- issues 272-349 correspond to issues 1-78 from bitbucket/conjure-private

We realise this is all a bit untidy, to say the least!
We hope not to move the repositories around any more!
