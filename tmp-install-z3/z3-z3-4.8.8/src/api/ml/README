This is the new ML API introduced with Z3 4.4. For the legacy bindings, please 
refer to previous releases of Z3.

On Windows, there are no less than four different ports of OCaml. The Z3 build 
system assumes that either the win32 or the win64 port is installed. This means
that OCaml will use `cl' as the underlying C compiler and not the cygwin or
mingw compilers.

OCamlfind: When ocamlfind is found, the `install' target will install the Z3
OCaml bindings into the ocamlfind site-lib directory. The installed package is
linked against the (dynamic) libz3 and it adds $(PREFIX)/lib to the library
include paths. On Windows, there is no $(PREFIX), so the build directory is
used instead (see META.in).
