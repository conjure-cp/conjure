$ Material: there are five different types of materials
$ Colour: there are three different types of bin, distinguished by colour
letting Material be new type enum {glass,plastic,steel,wood,copper},
        Colour be new type enum {red,green,blue}

$ quantity: the amount of each material that is required to be placed in bins
$ capacity: each bin type (colour) has a certain capacity
given quantity : function (total) Material --> int(0..),
      capacity : function (total) Colour --> int(0..)

$ Bin: bins are represented by an unnamed type. the number of values is the same
$      as the total amount of material that is required
letting Bin be new type of size (sum m : Material . quantity(m))

$ colour: each bin is assigned a colour
$ contents: the contents of each bin is a multiset of materials
find colour : function Bin --> Colour,
     contents : function Bin --> mset of Material

$ minimise the number of bins that have colours & materials assigned to them
minimising |defined(colour)|

such that
$ every bin that has a colour, must also have a contents, and vice versa
    forAll b : Bin . b in defined(colour) <-> b in defined(contents),
$ the correct amount of each material is spread across all the bins
    forAll m : Material . (sum b in defined(contents) . freq(contents(b),m))

    forAll b in defined(colour) . colour(b) = blue ->

$ green bins contain at most two wooden components
    forAll b in defined(colour) . colour(b) = green ->
                                   freq(contents(b),wood) <= 2,
