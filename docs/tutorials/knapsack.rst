The Knapsack problem
-------------------------
*Authors: Saad Attieh and Christopher Stone*

The Knapsack problem is a classical combinatorial optimisation problem, often used in areas of resource allocation. A basic variant of the Knapsack problem is defined as follows:

- Given:
    #. A set of items, each with a weight and a value,
    #. A maximum weight which we call *capacity*,
- find a set of the items such that
    #. The sum of the weights of the items in our set is less than or equal to the capacity,and 
    #. The sum of the values of the items is maximised.

Informally, think about putting items in a sack such that we maximise the total value of the sack whilst not going over the sack's weight limit.

We begin by showing the entire problem as defined in Essence:

.. code-block:: essence

    given items new type enum
    given weight : function (total) items --> int
    given gain : function (total) items --> int
    given capacity : int
    find picked : set of items
    maximising sum i in picked . gain(i)
    such that (sum i in picked . weight(i)) <= capacity

Going through the problem line by line:

We begin by defining the parameters to the problem.  Parameters are given in a separate file, allowing different instances of the same problem to be solved without having to change the specification.

Each parameter is denoted with the *given* keyword.

.. code-block:: essence

    given items new type enum

This line says that a set of items will be provided in the parameter file as an enum type.  Enums are good for labeling items where it makes no sense to attribute a value to each item.  So instead of using integers to represent each item, we may just assign names to each item and group the names under an enum type.   Below is an example enum declaration, as it would be written in the parameter file:

.. code-block:: essence

    letting items be new type enum {a,b,c,d,e}

``a``, ``b``, etc. are just names we have given, they could be anything ``bread``, ``whiskey``, ...  


.. code-block:: essence

    given weight : function (total) items --> int

Another parameter, a function that maps from each item to an integer, we will treat these integers as weights.  Since we are describing integers that will be given in the parameter file, no domain (lower/upper bound) is required.  Here is an example function parameter as given in a parameter file:

.. code-block:: essence

    letting weight be function
        ( a --> 15
        , b --> 25
        , c --> 45
        , d --> 50
        , e --> 60
        )

.. code-block:: essence

    given gain : function (total) items --> int

Just the same as the weight parameter, this parameter is used to denote a mapping from each item to a value.  An example value for this parameter as it would be defined in the parameter file is:

.. code-block:: essence

    letting gain be function
        ( a --> 10
        , b --> 20
        , c --> 40
        , d --> 40
        , e --> 50
        )

The final given:

.. code-block:: essence

    given capacity : int

The final parameter -- a weight limit.  Example value in parameter file:

.. code-block:: essence

    letting capacity be 80


.. code-block:: essence

    find picked : set of items

The ``find`` keyword denotes decision variables, these are the variables for which  the solver will search for a valid assignment. As is common in Essence problems, our entire problem is modelled using one decision variable named ``picked``.  Its type is ``set of items``; a set of any size whose elements are taken from the ``items`` domain.  Note, the maximum cardinality of the set is implicitly the size of the ``items`` domain.

.. code-block:: essence

    maximising sum i in picked . gain(i)

The ``maximising`` keyword denotes the objective for the solver; a value for the solver to *maximise*.  ``minimise`` is also a valid objective keyword.  The expression ``sum i in picked .`` is a quantifier. The ``sum`` says that the values we produce should be summed together.  The ``i in picked`` says we want to list out every element of the set ``picked``.  The expression given to the ``sum`` are described by the expression that follows the full-stop (``.``).  In this case, we are asking for the image of ``i`` in the ``gain`` function.  That is, for each item in the set, we are looking up the integer value that the item maps to in the ``gain`` function and summing these integers.
 

.. code-block:: essence

    such that (sum i in picked . weight(i)) <= capacity

The ``such that`` keyword denotes a constraint.  Here the constraint is formulated in a similar manner to the objective.  We are quantifying over the set of chosen items ``picked``, looking up the value that the item maps to in the ``weights`` function and summing these values to together.  We enforce that the result of the sum must be less than or equal to the capacity ``<= capacity``.

Note that you can post multiple constraints either by using commas between each constraint ``,`` or by reusing the keyword ``such that``.
