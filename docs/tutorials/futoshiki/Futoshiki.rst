Futoshiki

Problem
~~~~~~~

``n x n`` board where each column and row is filled with the unique numbers from 1 to ``n``, similar to a sudoku.
In contrast to sudoku, there are less than and greater than symbols between cells indicating that one cell has to be filled with a number greater than (or less than) than the cell on the other side of the operator.

Essence Model
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Let us look at the model first.

.. code-block:: essence

    language Essence 1.3
    given n : int
    letting DOMAIN be domain int(1..n)
    given hints : function (DOMAIN, DOMAIN) --> DOMAIN
    given less_than : relation of ((DOMAIN, DOMAIN) * (DOMAIN, DOMAIN))
    find board : matrix indexed by [DOMAIN, DOMAIN] of DOMAIN 
    such that
        forAll (hint,num) in hints .
            board[hint[1], hint[2]] = num,
        forAll i: DOMAIN .
            allDiff(board[i,..]),
        forAll j: DOMAIN .
            allDiff(board[..,j]),
        forAll (l,g) in less_than .
            board[l[1],l[2]] < board[g[1],g[2]]

The line by line explanation starts here.

.. code-block:: essence

    given n : int

Defines the size of the matrix and the maximal number of elements that we will add.

.. code-block:: essence

    letting DOMAIN be domain int(1..n)

We start at 1 and go up to ``n`` (for both the elements of the cells and the cell locations).

.. code-block:: essence

    given hints : function (DOMAIN, DOMAIN) --> DOMAIN

Here we define which cells are already filled in using a function. 
We map the coordinates onto the number that is in that cell. 
It is important to notice that functions in essence are partial functions not total. 
This means that not everything gets mapped.


.. code-block:: essence

    given less_than : relation of ((DOMAIN, DOMAIN) * (DOMAIN, DOMAIN))

Here we define where the relation symbols are placed, it depends on which way you read the symbol we are "only" modelling less than. 
So should there be a "greater than" signs between two cells, say ``(2,1)`` and ``(1,1)`` then we would order them as ``(1,1)`` is less than ``(2,1)``. 

.. code-block:: essence

    find board : matrix indexed by [DOMAIN, DOMAIN] of DOMAIN 

We are now telling the solver that we are trying to find a ``n x n`` board with elements from 1 to ``n`` in each cell.

.. code-block:: essence

    such that

This is the beginning of the constraints block.

.. code-block:: essence

     forAll (hint,num) in hints .
        board[hint[1], hint[2]] = num,

This constraint defines the hints, so the cells that are filled in when we get the puzzle.

.. code-block:: essence

    forAll i: DOMAIN .
        allDiff(board[i,..]),

This constraint defines that every cell in a row has to be a unique number between 1 and n.

.. code-block:: essence

    forAll j: DOMAIN .
        allDiff(board[..,j]),

This constraint defines that every cell in a column has to be a unique number between 1 and n.

.. code-block:: essence

    forAll (l,g) in less_than .
        board[l[1],l[2]] < board[g[1],g[2]]
        
Finally this constraint enforces the less than relation. ``l`` is the number that is the cell that contains the number that is less than then the cell ``g``.

Instance
~~~~~~~~

We save the instance in a ``.essence-param`` file.

.. code-block:: essence

    letting n be 4
    letting hints be function(
            (1,1) --> 2,
            (2,2) --> 2
    )
    letting less_than be relation(
            ((1,1) , (2,1)),
            ((4,2) , (3,2)),
            ((3,3) , (3,4)),
            ((3,4) , (4,4))
    )

The ``.essence-param`` file contains the information about our starting board of a specific instance that we want to solve.
See the picture at the beginning to see what it looks like.

.. code-block:: essence

    letting n be 4

We are dealing with a 4 by 4 board.

.. code-block:: essence

    letting hints be function(
            (1,1) --> 2,
            (2,2) --> 2
    )

There will be two ``2`` s on the board given as a hint. One in the top left corner ``(1,1)`` and the second number ``2`` in cell ``(2,2)``.

.. code-block:: essence

    letting less_than be relation(
            ((1,1) , (2,1)),
            ((4,2) , (3,2)),
            ((3,3) , (3,4)),
            ((3,4) , (4,4))
    )

There are 4 relation symbols on the board, between cells.

Solving
~~~~~~~

Using the ESSENCE pipeline, we can solve our sample instance by typing the following:

.. code-block:: bash

    conjure solve futoshiki-model.essence futoshiki-instance.essence-param

The result will be saved into a ``.solution`` file which will look something like this:

.. code-block:: essence

    letting board be
            [[2, 1, 4, 3; int(1..4)], [4, 2, 3, 1; int(1..4)], [3, 4, 1, 2; int(1..4)], [1, 3, 2, 4; int(1..4)]; int(1..4)]
    $ Visualisation for board
    $ 2 1 4 3
    $ 4 2 3 1
    $ 3 4 1 2
    $ 1 3 2 4
