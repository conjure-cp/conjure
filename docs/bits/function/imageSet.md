# imageSet

imageSet(f,x) is {f(x)} if f(x) is defined, or empty if f(x) is not defined
```
letting f be function(0 --> 10, 2 --> 20)
find s1 : set of int (9..11) such that s1 = imageSet(f, 0) ${"s1": [10]}
```
It is finding the solution of f(0) and convert the type to Set.

See it demonstrated [here](https://github.com/conjure-cp/conjure/blob/main/docs/notebooks/Function_operators.ipynb).
