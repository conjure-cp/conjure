# participants

union of all parts of a partition

```
letting P be partition({1,2},{3},{4,5,6})
find b : set of int(1..6) such that b = participants(P) ${1,2,3,4,5,6}
```
This result is getting all parts of the partition

See it demonstrated [here](https://github.com/conjure-cp/conjure/blob/main/docs/notebooks/Partition_operators.ipynb).
