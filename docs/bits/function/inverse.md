# inverse

test if two functions are inverses of each other
```
find a : bool such that a = inverse(function(0-->1),function(1-->0)) $ true
```
f(0) = 1 and f(1) = 0 They are inverse functions of each other.

See it demonstrated [here](https://github.com/conjure-cp/conjure/blob/main/docs/notebooks/Function_operators.ipynb).
