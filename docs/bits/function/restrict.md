# restrict
function restricted to a domain
```
letting f be function(0-->1,3-->4)
letting D be domain int(0,2)
find g : function int(0..4)-->int(0..4) such that g = restrict(f, D)
```
Using to extract a sub-function from a function, which is only defined within a specific domain. 

See it demonstrated [here](https://github.com/conjure-cp/conjure/blob/main/docs/notebooks/Function_operators.ipynb).
