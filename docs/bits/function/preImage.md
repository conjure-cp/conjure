# preImage

set of elements mapped by function to an element
```
letting f be function(1 --> 20, 2 --> 10, 3 --> 20)
find P : set of int (1..10) such that P = preImage(f, 20) ${"P": [1, 3]}
```
This represents the set of all input values that are mapped to 20.

See it demonstrated [here](https://github.com/conjure-cp/conjure/blob/main/docs/notebooks/Function_operators.ipynb).
