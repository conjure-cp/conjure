# range

set of values of function
```
letting f be function(-2 --> 1, 2 --> 2, 1 --> 3)
find y : int(1..3) such that y in range(f) $[{"y": 3}, {"y": 2}, {"y": 1}]
```
It is finding a value ```y``` within a certain range that belongs to the range of ```f```

See it demonstrated [here](https://github.com/conjure-cp/conjure/blob/main/docs/notebooks/Function_operators.ipynb).
