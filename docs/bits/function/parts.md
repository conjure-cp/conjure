# parts

partition to its set of parts

```
letting P be partition({1,2},{3},{4,5,6})
find d : bool such that d = ({{1,2},{3},{4,5,6}} = parts(P)) $true
```
This syntax is checking if {{1,2},{3},{4,5,6}} equals to partition P

See it demonstrated [here](https://github.com/conjure-cp/conjure/blob/main/docs/notebooks/Partition_operators.ipynb).
