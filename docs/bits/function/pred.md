# pred (predecessor)

predecessor of this element in an enumerated type

```
letting D be new type enum { North, East, South, West }
find a : D such that a = pred(East) $North
```
This result shows ```a``` must be the predecessor of ```East```.

See it demonstrated [here](https://github.com/conjure-cp/conjure/blob/main/docs/notebooks/Enumerated_type_operators.ipynb).
