# together

test if a list of elements are all in the same part of the partition

```
letting P be partition({1,2},{3},{4,5,6})
find e : bool such that e = together({1,2},P) $true
```
This syntax is checking if {1,2} is in the part of the partition P

See it demonstrated [here](https://github.com/conjure-cp/conjure/blob/main/docs/notebooks/Partition_operators.ipynb).
