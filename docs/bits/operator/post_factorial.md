# x! (factorial)

This is the factorial operator.

```x!``` will return the factorial of x - as in the product of all integers from ```1``` to ```x```.

When ``` x <= 0 ```, ```x! = 0```.

It can't be directly used in expressions with decision variables. For more information about this see [here.](https://conjure.readthedocs.io/en/latest/essence.html#arithmetic-operators)

To see how this works see [here](https://github.com/conjure-cp/conjure/blob/main/docs/notebooks/factorial.ipynb).
