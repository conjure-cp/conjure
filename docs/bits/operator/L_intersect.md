# intersect

Set of elements in both sets

```essence
find A : set of int(0..6) such that A = {1,2,3} intersect {2,3}
```
This syntax is finding the intersection part of {1,2,3} and {2,3}

See it demonstrated [here](https://github.com/conjure-cp/conjure/blob/main/docs/notebooks/Set_operators.ipynb).
