# subset

test if first set is strictly contained in second set (exclude two sets are equal)

```essence
find b : bool such that b = ({0,1} subset {0,1,3})
```
This syntax is testing if {0,1,3} contains {0,1}

See it demonstrated [here](https://github.com/conjure-cp/conjure/blob/main/docs/notebooks/Set_operators.ipynb).
