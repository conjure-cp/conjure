# subsetEq

test if first set is strictly contained in second set (two sets can be equal)

```essence
find b : bool such that b = ({0,1} subsetEq {0,1})
```
This syntax is testing if {0,1} contains {0,1}

See it demonstrated [here](https://github.com/conjure-cp/conjure/blob/main/docs/Set_operators.ipynb).
