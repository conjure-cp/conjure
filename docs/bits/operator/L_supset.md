# supset

test if the first set strictly contains the second set (exclude two sets are equal)

```essence
find b : bool such that b = ({2,1} supset {1})
```
This syntax is testing if {2,1} contains {1}

See it demonstrated [here](https://github.com/conjure-cp/conjure/blob/main/docs/notebooks/Set_operators.ipynb).
