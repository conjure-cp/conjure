This is the integer division operator.

The result is rounded down to the nearest integer.
This is meant to ensure that for integers x and y, y!=0
```
(x % y) + y * (x / y) = x
```
holds 

See a worked example [here](https://github.com/conjure-cp/conjure/tree/main/docs/notebooks/division_and_mod_demonstration.ipynb)

And a slightly more complex example using an instance of the n-fractions puzzle [here](https://github.com/conjure-cp/conjure/tree/main/docs/notebooks/division_n_fractions.ipynb)
