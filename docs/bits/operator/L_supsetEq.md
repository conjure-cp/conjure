# supsetEq

test if the first set contains the second set (two sets can be equal)

```essence
find b : bool such that b = ({2} supsetEq {2})
```
This syntax is testing if {2} contains {2}

See it demonstrated [here](https://github.com/conjure-cp/conjure/blob/main/docs/notebooks/Set_operators.ipynb).
