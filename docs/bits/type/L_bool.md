# bool

The Boolean domain is denoted with the keyword `bool` and has two values: `false` and `true`.

```essence
find a : bool such that a = (1 in {0,1})
```
This syntax is checking if 1 is in the set {0,1}

See it demonstrated [here](https://github.com/conjure-cp/conjure/blob/main/docs/L_bool.ipynb).
