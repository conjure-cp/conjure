# minSize

Takes an integer parameter, n.

When used with a function domain will limit the solutions to functions that contains at least n mappings.
When used with a sequence domain will limit the solutions to sequences that have a length greater than or equal to n.
When used with a relation domain will produce solutions with at least n tuples.
