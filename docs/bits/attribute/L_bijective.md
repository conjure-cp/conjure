# bijective 

When used with a function domain will restrict solutions to functions that are both [injective](https://github.com/conjure-cp/conjure/blob/main/docs/bits/attribute/L_injective.md) and [surjective](https://github.com/conjure-cp/conjure/blob/main/docs/bits/attribute/L_surjective.md).

This means that every element of the defined set has a unique mapping to a range element and every range element has a defined element that maps to it.

See it demonstrated [here](https://github.com/conjure-cp/conjure/blob/main/docs/notebooks/functionDemonstration.ipynb).
