# size 

Takes an integer parameter, n. 

When used with a function domain will limit the solutions to functions that contain n mappings.
When used with a relation domain will produce solutions with n tuples.

See it demonstrated on function domains [here](https://github.com/conjure-cp/conjure/blob/main/docs/notebooks/functionDemonstration.ipynb).
