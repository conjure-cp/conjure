# antiSymmetric

A relation is anti symmetric that for every ```a``` related to ```b```, where ```a != b```, ```b``` is not related to ```a```.

Essentially, if ```a``` is related to ```b``` and ```b``` is related to ```a```, then  ```a = b```.

See this demonstrated [here](https://github.com/conjure-cp/conjure/blob/main/docs/notebooks/RelationDomains.ipynb).
