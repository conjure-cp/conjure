# injective 

When used with a function domain will restrict solutions to functions where elements of the defined map uniquely to elements of the range.
When used with a sequence domain will ensure that each member of the domain appears at most once. 

See it demonstrated on functions [here](https://github.com/conjure-cp/conjure/blob/main/docs/notebooks/functionDemonstration.ipynb) and on sequences [here](https://github.com/conjure-cp/conjure/blob/main/docs/notebooks/SequenceDomains.ipynb).
