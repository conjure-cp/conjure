# surjective

When used with a function domain will restrict solutions to functions where there is a mapping to every element in the range.
When used with a sequence domain, ensures that each element of the domain range is featured at leats once.

See it demonstrated on functions [here](https://github.com/conjure-cp/conjure/blob/main/docs/notebooks/functionDemonstration.ipynb) and on sequences [here](https://github.com/conjure-cp/conjure/blob/main/docs/notebooks/SequenceDomains.ipynb).
