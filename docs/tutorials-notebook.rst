Tutorials using Conjure notebook
================================

We demonstrate the use of Conjure for some small problems.

Tutorials in this section are a copy of those in the tutorials section.
They are adapted to use the notebook extension for better interactivity.
We might add new tutorials using this style in the future.

See `conjure-notebook repository <https://github.com/conjure-cp/conjure-notebook>`_ for details.
