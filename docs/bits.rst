Bits
====

These *bits* of documentation are used in the Visual Studio Code extension for Conjure.
Search for `conjure-vs-code` inside VS Code to install this extension.
The extension is open source as well, and it is hosted at https://github.com/conjure-cp/conjure-vs-code.

We include them here for reference and convenience, but this part of the documentation is intended to be useful primarily through the VS Code extension.
