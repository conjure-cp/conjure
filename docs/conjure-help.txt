 conjure [COMMAND] ... [OPTIONS]
   The command line interface of Conjure takes a command name as the first
   argument followed by more arguments depending on the command.
   This help text gives a list of the available commands.
   For details of a specific command, pass the --help flag after the command
   name.
   For example: 'conjure translate-solution --help'
 
 Commands:
   [modelling]          The main act. Given a problem specification in
                        Essence, produce constraint programming models in
                        Essence'.
   translate-parameter  Refinement of parameter files written in Essence for a
                        particular Essence' model.
                        The model needs to be generated by Conjure.
   translate-solution   Translation of solutions back to Essence.
   validate-solution    Validating a solution.
   solve                This is a combined mode, and it is available for
                        convenience.
                        It runs Conjure in the modelling mode followed by
                        parameter translation if required, then Savile Row +
                        Minion to solve, and then solution translation.
   pretty               Pretty print as Essence file to stdout.
                        This mode can be used to view a binary Essence file in
                        textual form.
   diff                 Diff on two Essence files. Works on models,
                        parameters, and solutions.
   type-check           Type-checking a single Essence file.
   split                Split an Essence file to various smaller files. Useful
                        for testing.
   symmetry-detection   Dump some JSON to be used as input to ferret for
                        symmetry detection.
   parameter-generator  Generate an Essence model describing the instances of
                        the problem class defined in the input Essence model.
                        An error will be printed if the model has infinitely
                        many instances.
 
 Common flags:
   -? --help     Display help message
   -V --version  Print version information
 
 conjure [modelling] [OPTIONS] ESSENCE_FILE
   The main act. Given a problem specification in Essence, produce constraint
   programming models in Essence'.
 
 Logging & Output:
   -o --output-directory=DIR                  Output directory. Generated
                                              models will be saved here.
                                              Default value: 'conjure-output'
      --numbering-start=INT                   Starting value to output files.
                                              Default value: 1
      --smart-filenames                       Use "smart names" for the
                                              models.
                                              Turned off by default.
                                              Caution: With this flag, Conjure
                                              will use the answers when
                                              producing a filename. It will
                                              ignore the order of questions.
                                              This will become a problem if
                                              anything other than 'f' is used
                                              for questions.

                                              the applied rewritings or not.

                                                          in order to avoid
                                              having to parse textual Essence.
