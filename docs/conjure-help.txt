 Conjure: The Automated Constraint Modelling Tool
 
 conjure [COMMAND] ... [OPTIONS]
   The command line interface of Conjure takes a command name as the first
   argument followed by more arguments depending on the command.
   This help text gives a list of the available commands.
   For details of a specific command, pass the --help flag after the command
   name.
   For example: 'conjure translate-solution --help'
 
 Common flags:
   -? --help                                  Display help message
   -V --version                               Print version information
 
 conjure [modelling] [OPTIONS] ESSENCE_FILE
   The main act. Given a problem specification in Essence, produce constraint
   programming models in Essence'.
 
 Logging & Output:

                                              models will be saved here.
                                              Default value: 'conjure-output'
      --numbering-start=INT                   Starting value to output files.
                                              Default value: 1
      --smart-filenames                       Use "smart names" for the

                                              Caution: With this flag, Conjure
                                              will use the answers when
                                              producing a filename. It will
                                              ignore the order of questions.
                                              This will become a problem if
                                              anything other than 'f' is used
                                              for questions.
