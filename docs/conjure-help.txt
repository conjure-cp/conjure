 Conjure: The Automated Constraint Modelling Tool
 
 conjure [COMMAND] ... [OPTIONS]
   The command line interface of Conjure takes a command name as the first argument followed by more arguments depending
   on the command.
   This help text gives a list of the available commands.
   For details of a command, pass the --help flag after the command name.
   For example: 'conjure translate-solution --help'
 
 Common flags:
      --help                                  Display help message
      --version                               Print version information

   -q --strategy-q=STRATEGY                   Strategy for selecting the next question to answer. Options: f (for
                                              first), i (for interactive), r (for random), x (for all). Prepend a (for
