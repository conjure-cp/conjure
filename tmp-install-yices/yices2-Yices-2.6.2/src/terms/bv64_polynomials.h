 * BIT-VECTOR POLYNOMIALS WITH 64BIT COEFFICIENTS
 */

/*
 * Polynomials with small bit-vector coefficients
 * represented as arrays of monomials. This can be
 * used for bit-vector polynomials with bitsize between
 * 1 and 64.
 *
 * Each monomial is a pair <coeff, variable>
 * - coeff is a bit-vector constant, stored as a 64bit integer.
 * - variable is a 32bit integer.
 *
 * Most operations require the polynomial object to be normalized:
 * - the monomials must be sorted and all the coefficients must
 *   be non-zero and reduced modulo 2^bitsize.
 * - the last monomials must be an end marker (var = max_idx)
 *
 * Most related operations are defined in bvarith64_buffers.c.
