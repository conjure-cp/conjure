/*
 * MAPPING OF TERMS TO SOLVER OBJECTS
 */

#ifndef __INTERNALIZATION_TABLE_H
#define __INTERNALIZATION_TABLE_H

/*
 * An internalization table keeps track of variable substitutions and
 * of the internal object (egraph term or other) mapped to terms.  The
 * table stores a partition of term indices in a union-find data
 * structure.  All the elements of an equivalence class are equal and
 * mapped to the same solver object.  Each class contains a
 * distinguished root element. All elements other than the root are
 * uninterpreted term indices (i.e., variables).
 *
 * - For a root r we store:
 *      map[r] = object mapped to the class (or NULL)
 *     type[r] = type of the class
 *     rank[r] = an 8bit value for balancing the union-find structure
 *
 *   If rank[r] is 255 then the root is frozen. This means either that
 *   r is not an uninterpreted term or that r is mapped to a non-NULL object.
 *   It's not possible to merge two classes whose roots are both frozen.
 *
 *   If rank[r] is less than 255, then the root is free. This means
 *   that r is an uninterpreted term and is not mapped to any object
 *   yet (i.e., map[r] = NULL). The class of r has size >= 2^rank[r]
 *   and all elements in the class are uninterpreted. It's possible to
 *   merge r's class with another class.
 *
 *   The table is a partial map. The domain is defined by the set of 
 *   terms r such that type[r] != NULL_TYPE. If type[r] is NULL_TYPE,
 *   then r is implicitly considered to be a root (cf. intern_tbl_is_root
 *   and intern_tbl_get_root).
 *
 * - a non-root i must be an uninterpreted term index and map[i] is the
 *   parent of i in the union-find tree.
 *
 * To distinguish between roots and non-roots, we use the sign bit:
 *   map[i] < 0  if i is a root, and the object mapped to i is obtained
 *               by clearing the sign bit.
 *   map[i] >= 0 if i is not a root, then map[i] is a term (term index + polarity bit)
 *
 * For boolean classes, the polarity bit is significant: the
 * substitution may map a boolean index 'i' to term '(not t)'. Then
 * the root of 'i' is '(not t)'.
 *
 * The type of a class (attached to the class root) is the intersection type
 * of all the class elements. If the root is not frozen this is the exact
 * type of the class.
 *
 * WARNING: If a root r is frozen, then type[r] is guaranteed to be a
 * supertype of the class's type, but type[r] may be inexact. Finding
 * the exact type of frozen classes would require dynamically
 * recomputing the types as classes are merged. For example, given
 * the declarations:
 *   x :: real
 *   i :: int
 *   r := 3 x + 1
 * then r has type real. But if we merge x and i (i.e., assert x == i),
 * then the type of r becomes int.  We don't do this dynamic type computation.
 * Type[r] is set when r is added to a class, and it remain unchanged,
 * independent of substitutions like x == i.
