 * HASH TABLE FOR MAINTAINING EQUIVALENCE CLASSES
 *
 * Objects are represented by void* pointers and
 * an equivalence relation is defined by a match predicate.
 * The table stores one representative per class and allows
 * one to quickly find it.
 *
 * This module is similar to int_hash_classes, except that is uses pointers.
