PROBLEM NOTED ON MARCH 03, 2010
-------------------------------

There are kernel-dependencies in GLIBC so even code compiled and linked
statically may not work on old versions of linux (e.g., Yices 2 does
not run on plato, which has a 2.4 linux kernel). This is easy to
diagnose: the executable crashes with the message

   FATAL: kernel too old
   Segmentation fault

Our goal should be to ensure static binaries work on any linux 2.6 kernel?
Not sure we can really achieve that.
