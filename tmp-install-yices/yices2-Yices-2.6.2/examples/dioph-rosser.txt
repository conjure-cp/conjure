This is the example used by Rosser in his paper 
"A Note on the Linear Diophantine Equation" (1941).

The equation is 99 x_1 + 79 x_2 + 55 x_3 + 33 x_4 = 20.

The paper uses: 99 x_1 + 79 x_2 + 55 x_3 + 33 x_4 = K 
where K is a fixed parameter. The general solution given
in the paper is

x_1 =  2 K -   L +   M + 4 N
x_2 = -5 K             -11 N
x_3 =  3 K + 3 L       + 8 N
x_4 =    K - 2 L - 3 M +   N
