find var1:
        matrix indexed by [int(0, 5)] of
            function (maxSize factorial(0), total, bijective) (bool, bool, bool) -->
                mset (minSize 2, maxSize 4, minOccur 1, maxOccur 3) of bool
find var2:
        matrix indexed by [int(1..2, 2)] of relation of (int(2..4, 0) * (bool, bool) * relation of (bool * bool * bool))
find var3: bool
such that var3 in ({} : `set of bool`)
