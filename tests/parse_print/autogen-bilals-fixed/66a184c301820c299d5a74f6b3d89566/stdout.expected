             tuple (mset (maxSize 1, minOccur 3) of bool))
find var2:
        function (minSize min([5, 2, 0; int(6..8)]), surjective)
            matrix indexed by [int(5, 5)] of function (size 1, total, injective) bool --> bool
                --> tuple (relation (size 3) of (bool))
such that
    true,
