letting simple be domain relation of (bool*int)
letting sized be domain relation (size 1) of (bool*int)
letting sized2 be domain relation (minSize 1) of (bool*int)
letting sized3 be domain relation (maxSize 2) of (bool*int)
letting sized4 be domain relation (maxSize 2, minSize 1) of (bool*int)
letting all be domain relation (reflexive, irreflexive, coreflexive, symmetric, antiSymmetric, aSymmetric, transitive, total, connex, Euclidean, serial, equivalence, partialOrder,minSize 3, maxSize 4) of (int*int)
