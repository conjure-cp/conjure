$ The variant triggers refinement output that is vulnerable to the bug
find x : variant {i:int(1..3),b:bool}
$ The backslash at the end of the next line doesn't get eacaped, producing "... /\"
such that active(x,i) -> x[i]>2 /\
x[i]<5

$ Simpler cases that fail since `\ ` isn't a valid JSON escape sequence
find y:bool such that y /\ true
find z:bool such that and([z,true])
