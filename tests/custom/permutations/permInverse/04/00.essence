$ transform(p, x)[i] ~~> transform(p, x[transform(permInverse(p), i)])

find p : permutation (numMoved 3) of int(1..3)

find x : matrix [int(1..3)] of bool
find y : matrix [int(1..3)] of bool

such that y = transform(p, x)



$ keeping some of the more interesting solutions only
such that sum([toInt(x[i]) | i : int(1..3)]) = 2
