letting A be new type of size 3
find x : set of A

find p : permutation (numMoved 3) of A
$ such that x .<= transform([p], x)
such that quickPermutationOrder([p], x)

$ should have 2 additional solutions with quick, or more!

$ the above rule, Oz thinks can be written recursively for all types
$ produce aux for the rhs
$ forAll, forAll, forAll
$ membership constraints

$ find x' : ...
$ such that forAll i in x . transform([p], i) in x'
$ such that forAll i in x' . transform([permInverse(p)], i) in x

$ such that x .<= toSet([ transform([p], i) | i <- x])
