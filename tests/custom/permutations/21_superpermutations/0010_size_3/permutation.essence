given s : set of permutation of int(1..3)
given q : sequence (size 3) of int(1..3)

find qs : set of sequence (size 3) of int(1..3)
such that |qs| = |s| /\ and([ transform([p],q) in qs | p <- s])

find superperm : sequence (maxSize 100) of int(1..3)

such that
  and([ z substring superperm | z <- qs ])

minimising |superperm|
