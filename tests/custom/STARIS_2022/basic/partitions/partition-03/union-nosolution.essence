$ this tests what happens when participants is invoked but the domain of the set to find doesn't include all members of the partition
letting P be partition({1,2,3},{4,5,6},{7,8,9})
find a : set of int(1..5) $ the union of the participation P includes values outside of this range so solution won't be found
such that a = participants(P)
