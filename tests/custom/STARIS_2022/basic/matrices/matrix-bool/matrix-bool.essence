$ matrix indexed by a boolean tests
letting d be domain matrix indexed by [bool, int(1..5)] of int(1..2)
find a : d such that a[true] = [1, 2, 2, 2, 2], a[false] = [1,1,1,1,2]
find b : bool
such that b = (a[true][1] = 1)
find c : bool
such that c = (a[false][5] = 2)
find e : bool
such that e = (a[false][4] = 2)
