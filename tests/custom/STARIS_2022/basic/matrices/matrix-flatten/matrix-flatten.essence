$ testing basic use of flatten
letting d be domain matrix indexed by [int(1..2),int(1..5)] of int(1..5)
find m : d such that m[1] = [1, 2, 3, 5, 4], m[2] = [4, 4, 3, 3, 1]
find s : matrix indexed by [int(1..10)] of int(1..5)

$ this line is the successful flatten line
such that s = flatten(1, [[1, 2, 3, 5, 4],[4, 4, 3, 3, 1]])

$ the following line causes the bug because the inputs to the flatten function are out of order
$ such that s = flatten([[1, 2, 3, 5, 4],[4, 4, 3, 3, 1]], 1)
