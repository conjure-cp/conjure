This directory contains problem specifications written in Essence,
together with parameter files when needed.

The test is to produce *all* models, find *all solutions* using each and
compare the generated models&solutions to expected ones, found under a
directory called "expected".

The files generated by conjure will be under a directory called "outputs".

Use "--limit-time N" in the main tester to select which ones to run.
