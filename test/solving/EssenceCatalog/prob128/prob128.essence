given n_upper : int(1..)

$ n_places: the number of positions to place words
$ n_words: the number of words in the dictionary
given n_places, n_words : int(1..)

$ Place: place identifiers are represented as integers
$ Word: word identifiers are represented as integers
$ Alphabet: the integers being used to represent characters. in this case,
$           65..90 are ascii for A-Z
letting Place be domain int(1..n_places),
        Word be domain int(1..n_words),
        Alphabet be domain int(65..90)

$ length: the length of each place
$ inter: the indicies at which two places intersect
$ dict: the dictionary. maps word identifiers to alphabet elements
given length : function (total) Place --> int(1..n_upper),
      inter : function tuple (Place,Place) --> tuple (int(1..n_upper),int(1..n_upper)),
      dict : function (total) Word --> function int(1..n_upper) --> Alphabet

where
$ intersections should be symmetric
    forAll ((p1,p2),(i1,i2)) in inter . inter((p2,p1)) = (i2,i1),
$ the dictionary maps identifiers to valid sequences
    forAll s in range(dict) . forAll i : int(1..|s|) . i in defined(s)

$ crossword: a function mapping word places to words from the dictionary
find crossword : function (total) Place --> Word

such that
$ lengths of words and places match up
    forAll p : Place . |dict(crossword(p))| = length(p),
$ the letters at intersections match up
    forAll ((p1,p2),(i1,i2)) in toSet(inter) .
        dict(crossword(p1))(i1) = dict(crossword(p2))(i2),
$ no word in the dictionary is used more than once
    forAll p1,p2 : Place . crossword(p1) =  crossword(p2) -> p1 = p2
