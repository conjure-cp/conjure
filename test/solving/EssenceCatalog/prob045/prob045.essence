$ This is the decision version of the cover test problem

given k,b,t: int(1..), g: int(2..)
where k>=t, b>=g**t

letting alphabet be new type of size g
letting switches be new type of size k

find CoverTest: mset (size b) of function (total) switches --> alphabet

such that
    forAll combination: set(size t) of switches.                 $ for every combination of t switches
    forAll testcase: function (total) combination --> alphabet.  $ for every test case involving that combination
    exists test in CoverTest. testcase subsetEq test              $ that test case must be covered by some test in the CoverTest
